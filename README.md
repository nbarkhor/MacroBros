# MacroBros
Within this github repository are our HTML, CSS and backend files used to create our application, MacroBros. It is
an application currently developed for a phone/mobile app, but we have developed it on a computer instead of using swift or 
phone programming languages at this current time, as per instruction of the professor. 
The first link to the application is the welcome page, under file called index.html, and it is followed by a sign-up or sign-in page and following that are 
input options for user's preferred distrubution of macronutrients. Following this, recipes selected for the users preferences
will appear and the user can select the recipes they particularly like and the full recipe will then appear.
